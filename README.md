# JournalApp

Summary 

The goal of this project is to create an application for smart phones that keeps notes for the user. 
The application will be designed for android, since that is the phone, I possess and software I am most familiar with. 
The application will allow the user to create entries with a given title.
The note entries will also have the ability to be given tags that the user can use to search for each entry with.
Additionally, the user will be able to highlight certain words within a note entry and link that word to another entry. 
Tapping the word will display a quick summary of the word and double tapping will take the user to the entry’s page.

Purpose 

The reason I wanted to make this application was twofold. Firstly, as a student it’s nice to have your notes organized. 
Secondly, I like to do a lot of creative writing and when I looked for apps to help keep my thoughts organized, 
I couldn’t find any that offered the kind of tools I wanted for organizing my notes. 
The applications I searched for either didn’t have the features I wanted or didn’t allow for notes to be organized how I desired.

My Application 

My application will have both the ability to create tags for entries as well as the ability to add hyperlinks between note pages.
Its unique function, however, will be that it will display a summary of the note pages when highlighting the hyperlinks.
In all the application will have both tags and hyperlinks to pages as well as a pop-up summary displayed when the hyperlink text is selected.
Notes would be organized into large note files with the ability to further organize into folders. You would be able to search notes by title or by the note’s tags.
